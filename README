You are the new Front End Developer at this new shiny start-up, Acme
Email. The product the company is feverishly trying to push out is a
Message Processor (c).
 
Message Processor (c) is going to be a single page web application,
relying heavily on javascript and new html 5 goodness. It is a going to be
a very large application - below is only a small part.
 
The Message Processor (c) processes different type of messages. The
logged in user will see how many messages are waiting to be processed (in
their own personal queue) and how many messages they have processed -
something of a dashboard. A list of the next 5 messages is also displayed.
When the user clicks on a message in this list, the message is displayed
in some type of panel. There are two types of messages:
 
* Birthday Wish
* Congrats on the birth of your child
 
The Birthday wish message will display:
 
* Name
* Standard Message Text - 'Mate, Happy Birthday. To celebrate this
once a year occasion we have picked the following gift: [gift]. Enjoy.'
 
The user must select the gift the person will receive. The list of gifts
doesn't change much, maybe once every two months as gifts become in and
out of stock. There are about 10 gifts to choose from
 
The 'Congrats on the birth of your child' message will display:
 
* Name
* Standard Message Text - 'Whooa well done and congratulations on
the birth of [babyname] on [birthdate].'
 
The user must selected the date of birth for the child and also what the
name of the child should be. The list of names is huge, and doesn't
change.
 
Once the user fills in the required details the message is sent. It
should appear on the processed list and be removed from the to do list.
 
The artwork and some of the design is being done by Billy Bob, Acme's own
design guru, which will be incorporated later on.
